## Getting started

Welcome to Paws & Pearls

## Description
Be ready to be immersed in a relaxing and productive simulation game. The player is the owner of boba cafe where you will be able to create bubble tea orders while also interacting with various animals. After working so hard, the game will allow you "clock out" and take a much deserved break. Players can utilize this time to lock in, eat food, or if they wanted to, continue to serve customers for as long as they desire. Our goal is to make a super cute background game that players can use however they would like.


## Gameplay
You play as a boba barista while serving various cute animal NPCs. Customers will walk into the class at random, walk to the counter, and then place a random order. You can then click on the pink tea machine behind the counter to make the order. A pop up will appear when you click on the machine that includes an empty cup and ingredients. You can drag and drop the ingredients into the cup. One tea and one topping is required to make a completed drink. The input slots are in the middle and bottom middle of the cups (it may take a couple tries).

## Roadmap
As for the future of this project, we want to expand more on the studying aspect of the game. We hope to incorporate a study room/lounge and any other features that create an inititave to have a relaxing study session. Of course, we also plan to add more fun characters and recipes in the future! We want to incorporate more options for customization through the character deisgn, the cafe interior, and so much more. We also hope to polish the art and animations of our game.
